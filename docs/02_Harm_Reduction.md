# Harm Reduction and Ethical Safeguards

This document summarizes the harm-reduction and data-protection measures applied in the study  
*“The Battle for Russia’s Rebirth: Interpreting Pro-War Critical Patriotism and Imperial Nationalism on Telegram.”*

## 1. Scope and Ethical Rationale
The project examines patterns of political communication within openly accessible Telegram media ecosystems.  
All data originates from **public channels operated by organizations, media outlets, or high-profile political bloggers**.  
The research purpose is **analytical and non-commercial**—to study network dynamics and ideological framing, not to expose or monitor individual behavior.  

The study follows ethical guidance from the **[APSA Principles of Professional Conduct](https://apsanet.org/Portals/54/diversity%20and%20inclusion%20prgms/Ethics/APSA%20Ethics%20Guide%20-%20Final%20-%20February2022_Council%20Approved.pdf?ver=5mQAFYQz3xLhbd4OkQWg6Q%3D%3D#:~:text=General%20Principles:,and%20presentations%20of%20their%20work.)**.

## 2. Public-Sphere Limitation
All channels included in this dataset are **publicly available Telegram media outlets, political groups, or well-known bloggers** with open-access content.  
No private chats, invite-only groups, or user-level communications were accessed.  
The collection process used the official **Telegram API (via Telethon)**, which retrieves only publicly accessible content in compliance with Telegram’s Terms of Service.

## 3. Exclusion of Personal or Sensitive Data
To prevent any potential harm or doxxing:
- No personal user identifiers (usernames, phone numbers, message IDs tied to individuals) are collected, stored, or analyzed.  
- Only public **channel-level data** (e.g., channel name, channel ID, message text, and timestamp) is processed.  
- Mentions or quotations of specific individuals within messages are not linked to identifiable persons outside the public domain.
- Non-textual content such as images, videos, or voice messages is automatically excluded from collection and analysis to prevent the accidental capture of personally identifiable information.

## 4. Minimizing Exposure to Harmful Content
Given the nature of the studied discourse (wartime and nationalist narratives), the dataset may include propaganda, hate speech, or disinformation.  
To mitigate risks:
- No full-text corpus is released publicly;   
- No visual materials, images, or metadata containing personal data are included.  
- Any content that could be construed as calls for violence or harassment is **excluded from replication materials**.

## 5. Responsible Data Sharing
- Public release includes only **aggregated statistics, anonymized excerpts, and analysis scripts**.  
- Researchers requesting controlled access to full-text data must provide institutional affiliation and a brief description of research goals.  
- Data are used strictly for **academic replication and peer verification**, not for surveillance, journalism, or advocacy purposes.
