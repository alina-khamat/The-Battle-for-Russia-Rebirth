# Sampling Procedure

We employed an **Exponential Discriminative Snowball Sampling (EDSS)** procedure to identify Telegram channels constituting the *‚Äúcritical patriotic‚Äù* segment of Russia‚Äôs pro-war infosphere.  
The method combined **algorithmic network expansion** based on repost ties with **manual exclusion** of nodes deemed irrelevant in terms of their communicative function or ideological alignment.

---

## 1. Sampling Design

The sampling proceeded in two iterative waves:

- **Seeds:** Four high-reach Telegram channels were selected as the initial ‚Äúseed‚Äù nodes that best fit our theoretical definition of wartime *critical patriotism*:  
  - Konstantin Malofeev ([@kvmalofeev](https://t.me/kvmalofeev))  
  - Igor Strelkov ([@strelkovii](https://t.me/strelkovii))  
  - Direct Action‚ö°Z ([@adirect](https://t.me/adirect))  
  - Rybar ([@rybar](https://t.me/rybar))  

- **Time Frame:** February 24, 2022 ‚Äì September 1, 2024.  

- **Inclusion Thresholds:**  
  - Wave 1 ‚Äî ‚â•5 reposts  
  - Wave 2 ‚Äî ‚â•10 reposts

## 2. Exclusion Criteria

In both waves, identical qualitative exclusion rules were applied to prevent the inflation of network density by channels that do not contribute to the measurement of *value-driven or identity-based communicative alignment*.  
Channels were **excluded** if they met any of the following criteria:

1. **News aggregators**, focusing exclusively on factual news dissemination (e.g., *RIA Novosti*).  
2. **Official or state-affiliated** channels representing government institutions or individual state officials (e.g., *Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation*).  
3. **Foreign-focused** channels that do not cover Russian domestic politics or the Russia‚ÄìUkraine war (e.g., *Tales from the Favelas*, *Balkan Gossip*).  
4. **Irregularly reposted** channels ‚Äî defined as those appearing in fewer than 3 out of 11 temporal quarterly snapshots, to exclude episodic, event-driven connections rather than sustained communicative ties.  
5. **Deleted, blocked, or private** channels.
